## A Software License Intended To Maximize Collaborative Value Creation

Here's the first draft of a new software license called the [Peer Production Royalty Token License](license.md).

The intent of this license is to create a low friction business model for open innovation and collaborative value creation. It provides an alternative to forming competitive product companies that provide economic support at the cost of collaborative solution potential.

The license favors open contribution filtered by a core group. It features balanced autonomous control of contributions by trusted agents, rapid collective decision making by Core Contributors when needed, and rapid iterative agreement amendment to adapt to the unknown.

The license dynamically allocates valuable tradable tokens backed by peer produced royalty revenue. This is done without the necessity of debt, investment, or legal filings. This provides resilience to those without access to capital in the developing world, collapsed economies, and recessions.

Here's how value is created. Individuals or companies pay a royalty fee for revenue made by hosting, selling, or distributing licensed software. Open source contributors, product managers, designers, and marketers receive a percentage of royalties in proportion to the work they do. This work is tracked through the distribution of "Royalty Sharing Tokens" ("RSTs") on a ledger managed by the association brought into existence by the contract in the repository.

If legal research has been accurate, the adoption of this license does not require the filing of paperwork for forming a legal entity. It creates an unincorporated association simply through the contractual agreement specified in the license. Research by Swarm.fund on lightweight unincorporated associations in California as a basis for token issuance is a promising direction. The jurisdiction the association is formed in is of particular concern and requires further investigation regarding limitation of liability, the holding of assets, and tax ramifications.

To minimize tax complications, royalties would be distributed directly to token holders as ordinary income and the unincorporated association formed by the license would hold no assets. All financial interactions may occur at the edge of the association with only the tracking of royalty rights administered by the association.

Ideally open source contributors would be free to trade Royalty Sharing Tokens for money if they choose. Investors who want to further the development of software can pay contributors in exchange for a portion of their Royalty Sharing Tokens but would not pay money directly to the association. These negotiations would also occur at the edge of the organization. Many of the associations created in this manner would not need to open a bank account. The transfer of ownership would be tracked on the Royalty Sharing Token Table in a publicly accessible and cloneable git repository (e.g. [Github](http://github.com)).

The first version of the license is intended to be suitable for software development with just git repository tracking. However, there is potential to automate the royalty token accounting using CryptoCurrency and co-budgeting solutions such as [SwarmBot](https://github.com/citizencode/swarmbot) and [CoBudget](https://github.com/cobudget).

There is also potential to generalize this license to non-software use cases. The [self-organization constitution](https://github.com/citizencode/self-organization-constitution) may be considered an elaboration on the governance section of this document.

Your feedback on why you would or would not use a formalized version of this license is valuable. I welcome respectful critique and references to prior art.

If you are committed to using this approach for your product, investment, or service offering let me know! Commitments by lawyers to contribute to this contract would also be welcome. Your early enthusiasm encourages me to continue iterating.

Attribution - many thanks (and no blame) to Joel Dietz (Swarm), Derek Razo (Enspiral), Tony Lai (LawGives), Chelsea Robinson (Enspiral), Matthew Schutte, Primavera De Fillipi (Backfeed, Harvard Berkman Center), Christopher Allen, and my team mates at [Citizen Code](http://citizencode.io) for helping develop the concepts explored here.

Caveats. This is an experimental license. I am not a lawyer. This should not be construed as legal advice.
