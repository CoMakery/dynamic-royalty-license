**Here's the first draft for a new open source license and company operating agreement to form a [Dynamic Equity Organization](license.md).**

The intent is to create a **lightweight legal entity and open collaboration business model**. It provides an alternative to forming a competitive product company that provides economic support at the cost redundant effort and reduced innovation potential.

The license specifies open contribution filtered by a core group. It features balanced autonomous control of contributions by trusted agents, rapid collective decision making by Core Contributors when needed, and rapid iterative agreement amendment to adapt to the unknown.

The license dynamically allocates  "Coins" backed by the value of royalty revenue. This is done without the necessity of debt, investment, or legal filings (looking into this). This provides resilience to entrepreneurs, those without access to capital in the developing world, collapsed economies, and recessions. These Coins can be issued and tracked transparently on a blockchain with a tool like [Swarmbot](https://github.com/citizencode/swarmbot).

Using open source software as an example, here's how royalties are distributed. Individuals or companies pay a royalty fee for revenue made by hosting, selling, or distributing licensed software. Open source contributors, product managers, designers, and marketers receive a percentage of royalties in proportion to the work they do. This work is tracked through the distribution of Coins on a ledger managed by the organization. The coins are brought into existence by the contract in the repository.

Research by Swarm.fund on lightweight unincorporated associations in California as a basis for token issuance indicates a promising direction. Simply signing an agreement specified in the license brings an unincorporated association into existence without the requirement of filing paperwork with the government. The jurisdiction the association is formed in is of particular concern and requires further investigation regarding limitation of liability, the holding of assets, and tax ramifications.

Although the license is targeted to be created simply by people signing an agreement (ie unincorporated assocation), the license should be suitable for conversion into an LLC operating agreement. This allows the agreement to function as a founders agreement if a different legal structure is required.

Ideally open source contributors would be free to trade Coins for money if they choose. This potentially enables compatibility with new [SEC crowd funding rules](http://www.sec.gov/news/pressrelease/2015-249.html) that go into effect on January 29th, 2016. Relatedly, investors who want to further the development of software can pay contributors to make contributions in exchange for a portion of the contribution Coins that contributors earn. Although it does not bypass accredited investor rules, this avoids the need to pay money directly to the organization. Cash for equity negotiations can occur at the edge of the organization which may avoid the necessity of the organization opening a bank account.

The first version of the license is intended to be suitable for software development with just git repository tracking. However automated services can also track dynamic issuance such as Citizen Code's [SwarmBot](https://github.com/citizencode/swarmbot) and Enspiral's [CoBudget](https://github.com/cobudget).

Your feedback on why you would or would not use a formalized version of this license is valuable. I welcome respectful critique and references to prior art. Opening a [Github issue](https://github.com/citizencode/dynamic-equity-organization/issues) is a great way to track desires and concerns.

If you are committed to using this approach for your product, investment, or service offering let me know! Commitments by lawyers to contribute to this contract are especially welcome. Your early enthusiasm encourages me to continue iterating.

Attribution - many thanks (and no blame) to Joel Dietz (Swarm), Derek Razo (Enspiral), Tony Lai (LawGives), Chelsea Robinson (Enspiral), Matthew Schutte, Primavera De Fillipi (Backfeed, Harvard Berkman Center), Christopher Allen, Alexis Gonzales-Black and my team mates at [Citizen Code](http://citizencode.io) for helping develop the concepts explored here.

Caveats. This is an experimental license. I am not a lawyer. This should not be construed as legal advice.
