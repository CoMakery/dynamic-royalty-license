# Governance Agreement

The Core Contributors agree as follows:

## Definitions

"Dynamic Royalty License Agreement" means the license agreement for the Intellectual Property at **[insert URL of license agreement]**.

"Proposal Address" means the mailing list, repository, wiki, chat server, or other communication service for the Core Contributors that is hosted by **[insert host name]**, with an archive at **[insert url of mailing list archive]** (the "Proposal Address").

Unless otherwise defined in this agreement, all terms utilized herein have the meanings stated in the Dynamic Royalty License Agreement.

## Voting

All voting by the Core Contributors, including the approvals required under the Dynamic Royalty License Agreement, will be made in response to a proposal message by a Core Contributor that is delivered to the Proposal Address with "[VOTE]" as the first text in the message (a "Proposal Message").

Votes will be cast by Core Contributors by replying to a Proposal Message with a range of numeric values between "-1" and "+1" as the first character in the body of that replying message. "+1" indicates a Vote in favor of the proposal. Only a "-1" will indicate a desire to block the proposal (a "Blocking Objection").

A proposal is adopted if less than 25% of Core Contributors have replied with a Blocking Objection and 7 days (168 hours) has elapsed from when the Proposal Message was delivered to the Proposal Address.

## Committees

The Core Contributors may designate, by Vote, committees (each, a "Committee") to (1) review contributions, (2) issue Royalty Tokens, (3) manage the Royalty Token Table, (4) manage the Notice Message Address, and (5) manage the Proposal Address.

Each Committee will consist of one or more of the Core Contributors. Any such Committee, to the extent provided in an adopted proposal of the Core Contributors, will have and may exercise all the powers and authority of the Core Contributors in the review of contributions, issuance of Royalty Tokens, and maintenance of the Royalty Token Table, Notice Message Address, and Proposal Address.

A Committee will authorize its actions by a Vote of the Committee, or as otherwise described by an adopted proposal of the Core Contributors with respect to that Committee.

## Royalty Tokens

The Core Contributors, or a duly authorized Committee, shall (1) review each contribution of intellectual property to the Intellectual Property by the Contributors, and determine, by Vote, whether the contribution is accepted, and if so, the number of Royalty Tokens to be issued in connection with that acceptance, as described in the Dynamic Royalty License Agreement, (2) maintain, and make reasonably available to the Contributors, the Royalty Token Table, Proposal Address and the Notice Message Address.

The Core Contributors shall award tokens (the "Royalty Tokens") to the Contributors for each contribution of intellectual property that is accepted by the Core Contributors and included in the Intellectual Property. The amount of Royalty Tokens awarded will be based upon the following formula:

Royalty Token Award = Base Award x Risk Factor

"Risk Factor" means:

- (4) if less than $1,000 in Royalties has been distributed to the Contributors in the 1 year period prior to the award.
- (2) if $1,000 to $100,000 in Royalties have been distributed to the Contributors in the 1 year period prior to the award.
- (1) if more than $100,000 in Royalties have been distributed to the Contributors in the 1 year period prior to the award.

"Base Award" means:
- (50) Insightful comment resulting in an improvement to the Intellectual Property
- (100) Small contribution equivalent to approximately one skillful hour of insight
- (200) Small software contribution with test coverage
- (800) Standard contribution
- (1600) Standard software contribution with test coverage

The Core Contributors shall record the issuance of Royalty Tokens in a table that is reasonably accessible to the Contributors (the "Royalty Token Table"). The Core Contributors shall provide a copy of the Royalty Token Table to any Contributor upon a written request to the Notice Message Address.

Any Contributor may assign ownership of any Royalty Tokens that the Contributor holds by written request to the Notice Message Address, and the Core Contributors shall update the Royalty Token Table to reflect such assignment.

## Adding or Removing Core Contributors

The Core Contributors may add a Core Contributor by a Vote of the Core Contributors. The Core Contributors may remove a Core Contributors by a Vote of the Core Contributors, excluding the Core Contributor whose removal is the subject of that Vote.

## Agreement Consents

Each Core Contributor shall, promptly upon being duly approved to be added as a Core Contributor, sign this agreement by messaging the Proposal Address with a message with a subject, body, repository submission, or primary message field that begins with "[SIGN] Governance Agreement". No individual or entity will be deemed a Core Contributor without signing this agreement as described in this section.

The Core Contributors agree to the terms of the Dynamic Royalty License Agreement.

## Jurisdiction, Venue, and Governing Law

Any action or suit relating to this agreement may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the party resides or in which the party conducts its primary business, and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions.

## Modifications

This agreement may be amended by a Vote of the Core Contributors except that to the extent that there are any conflicts or inconsistencies between this agreement, or an amendment to this agreement, and the Dynamic Royalty License Agreement, the provisions of the Dynamic Royalty License Agreement will govern and control.

The Core Contributors shall promptly revise this agreement to reflect any duly authorized amendments.
