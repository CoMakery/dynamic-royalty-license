## Agreements

### Vision

[How this organization will make the world a better place. This should be specific enough to guide decisions by determining if an action will be in or out of alignment with the vision.]

### Values

[What the community values are These should be specific enough to guide decisions by determining if an action will be in or out of alignment with the values.]

### Core Contributors

[Names of individual contributors who are part of the decision making process]

### Royalties

7.5% of gross revenue derived from the sale, hosting, or distribution of this software will be shared with the Royalty Token Holders on a prorata basis.

### Royalty Token Bounties

Core Contributors can accept repository contributions and issue bounties autonomously without a governance process. Only work accepted by a Core Contributor receives a bounty.

```
Bounty Award = Base Bounty x Quality x Risk Factor
```

"Risk Factor"

- (3) if less than $5,000 in royalties has been distributed to stakeholders in the last year.
- (2) if $5,000 to $100,000 in royalties have been distributed in the last year.
- (1) if more than $100,000 in royalties have been distributed in the last year.

"Base Bounty" Coin amount for contributions that are accepted by Core Contributors is:
- (100) Core Contributor hourly rate
- (100) Minor Open Contribution
- (1000) Open Contribution

"Quality" multiples:
- 1.5x bounty multiple for increasing community knowledge, collaboration, design cohesion, and code quality on an issue through a collaborative submission (e.g. pair programming, design / dev pair). These bounties will be split between the submitters.
- 2x bounty multiple for commits that include test coverage.

Once an Coin bounty has been awarded and recorded in the Royalty Sharing Token Table, these Coins can only be transferred by permission or request of the Coin owner.

### Coin Table

One canonical Coin Table will be used to track ownership of royalty sharing tokens ("Coins"). It will be available and reasonably accessible to all Coin holders. Core Contributors are responsible for furnishing the latest Coin Table data to any Coin holder that requests it.

By default the Coin Table will be tracked in the initial designated origin master repository accessible to all Core Contributors. A new Royalty Sharing Token Table may be designated through a proposal by Core Contributors as long the existing Royalty Token Ownership is migrated to the new system of record.

| Contributor     | Coins   |
| :-------------  | :------------- |
|                 | 0       |

## Governance

Core Contributors may make proposals to:
- Add another Core Contributor
- Remove another Core Contributor
- Modify royalty or default bounty amounts for versions of the repository created after the proposal is adopted.
- Core Contributors may propose a "Coin Fork". This is different than simply forking and extending the repository as a user.

In the case of a "Coin Fork" the new repository will begin with a duplicate of old Royalty Token Table distribution. New Core Contributors to the repository will be proposed and determined by the original Core Contributors. If this occurs then the forked repository may dynamically issue Coins that only apply to the royalty distribution table for the new repository.

## Proposal Process

Each Core Contributor may have their vote counted once for each product proposal. They are free to alter their vote prior to the quorum required for proposal adoption. Proposals, votes, and written dialog about proposals are public to all Royalty Sharing Token holders and Core Committers.

1. The proposer (who must be a Core Contributor) creates a new pull request with the proposal. The tension to be addressed by the proposal is included in the commit message.
1. Core Contributors respond with clarifications, reactions, and a vote of "+1", "+0", or "-1". To constructively accommodate potential disinterest, any Core Contributor can abstain from participating.
1. Anyone can request that the proposal be discussed on a phone call or video call.
1. The proposal is adopted immediately if all Core Contributors respond with either +1 or +0.
1. The proposal is adopted if less than 25% of Core Contributors respond "-1" and 25% or more respond "+1" within 2 weeks of the final proposal modification.
