## Royalty Tokens

"Base Award" means:

- (100) Core Contributor hourly rate
- (100) Minor Open Contribution
- (1000) Open Contribution

"Quality" means:

- 1.5x bounty multiple for increasing community knowledge, collaboration, design cohesion, and code quality on an issue through a collaborative submission (e.g. pair programming, design / dev pair). These bounties will be split between the submitters.
- 2x bounty multiple for commits that include test coverage.

The Core Contributors shall record the issuance of Royalty Tokens in a table that is reasonably accessible to to the Contributors (the "Royalty Token Table"). The Core Contributors shall provide a copy of the Royalty Token Table to any Contributor upon a written request to the Notice E-Mail Address.

Any Contributor may assign ownership of any Royalty Tokens that the Contributor holds by written request to the Notice E-Mail Address, and the Core Contributors shall update the Royalty Token Table to reflect such assignment.

## Royalty Payments

You shall pay the Contributors a royalty of 7.5% of Your Gross Sales Revenue (the "Royalties") using the Bitcoin digital currency to the following Bitcoin address [insert Bitcoin address]. The Core Contributors shall be responsible for distributing the Royalties to the Contributors on a prorata basis as determined by the Royalty Token Table.

You shall pay the Royalties quarterly in arrears within 60 days after the end of each calendar quarter. Your obligation to pay the Royalties shall survive the expiration or earlier termination of this agreement.

You shall provide a report, upon request by any of the Core Contributors, indicating the method and basis of calculation of any payment of the Royalties, however You will be under no obligation to provide customer names or contact information in such report.

## Governance

Core Contributors may make proposals to:
- Add another Core Contributor
- Remove another Core Contributor
- Modify royalty or default bounty amounts for versions of the repository created after the proposal is adopted.
- Core Contributors may propose a "Coin Fork". This is different than simply forking and extending the repository as a user.

In the case of a "Coin Fork" the new repository will begin with a duplicate of old Royalty Token Table distribution. New Core Contributors to the repository will be proposed and determined by the original Core Contributors. If this occurs then the forked repository may dynamically issue Coins that only apply to the royalty distribution table for the new repository.

## Proposal Process

Each Core Contributor may have their vote counted once for each product proposal. They are free to alter their vote prior to the quorum required for proposal adoption. Proposals, votes, and written dialog about proposals are public to all Royalty Sharing Token holders and Core Committers.

1. The proposer (who must be a Core Contributor) creates a new pull request with the proposal. The tension to be addressed by the proposal is included in the commit message.
1. Core Contributors respond with clarifications, reactions, and a vote of "+1", "+0", or "-1". To constructively accommodate potential disinterest, any Core Contributor can abstain from participating.
1. Anyone can request that the proposal be discussed on a phone call or video call.
1. The proposal is adopted immediately if all Core Contributors respond with either +1 or +0.
1. The proposal is adopted if less than 25% of Core Contributors respond "-1" and 25% or more respond "+1" within 2 weeks of the final proposal modification.
